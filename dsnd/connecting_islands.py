Problem Statements
In an ocean, there are n islands some of which are connected via bridges. Travelling over a bridge has some cost attaced with it. Find bridges in such a way that all islands are connected with minimum cost of travelling.

You can assume that there is at least one possible way in which all islands are connected with each other.

You will be provided with two input parameters:

num_islands = number of islands

bridge_config = list of lists. Each inner list will have 3 elements:

 a. island A
 b. island B
 c. cost of bridge connecting both islands
Each island is represented using a number

Example:

num_islands = 4
bridge_config = [[1, 2, 1], [2, 3, 4], [1, 4, 3], [4, 3, 2], [1, 3, 10]]
Input parameters explanation:

1. Number of islands = 4
2. Island 1 and 2 are connected via a bridge with cost = 1
   Island 2 and 3 are connected via a bridge with cost = 4
   Island 1 and 4 are connected via a bridge with cost = 3
   Island 4 and 3 are connected via a bridge with cost = 2
   Island 1 and 3 are connected via a bridge with cost = 10
In this example if we are connecting bridges like this...

between 1 and 2 with cost = 1
between 1 and 4 with cost = 3
between 4 and 3 with cost = 2
...then we connect all 4 islands with cost = 6 which is the minimum traveling cost.
